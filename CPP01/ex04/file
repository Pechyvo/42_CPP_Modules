When I look in the mirror, I see meâ€”someone who has grown, learned, and changed over time.
Sometimes, me is confident and ready to take on the world; other times, me is uncertain and searching for answers.
But no matter what, me is always trying to do better, to be kinder, and to make a difference.
The journey of me is ongoing, and every day brings a new opportunity to discover what me can become.
